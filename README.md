## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at the Kricker Innovation Hub as the Regional Network Coordinator. My core responsibilities are to manage our CRM and track/process all data metrics for our grants, as well as connect community members with local resources.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning additional data analysis skills as I prepare for a masters in data science and I want to start learning more about computer programing. Although at the moment I'm taking some classes in a business undergrad program. I really don't think there's ever been a time I havn't been engaged in some sort of continuing education.
